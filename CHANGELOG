* Changed to case insensitive check on Websocket upgrade headers (required for
  MS Edge and compliance with RFC6455). HT: ossandust
* Fixed Javascript in sample page to correctly handle port 80. HT: ossandust

V0.8.6 - January 17, 2016

* Changed IServer/ISocket server interface to take the port number as a parameter
  in the constructor rather than on the Start() method. This makes it more
  generic (and simplifies the integration with SensHub).
* Added support for sending binary WebSocket frames (requested on Slack).
* Changed filter interface to support before and after filter hooks. This makes
  it easy to do things like time request handling and perform logging. Also
  allows for custom HTTP error pages.
